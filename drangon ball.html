The series combines martial arts, humor, and adventure, introducing iconic characters like Bulma, Master Roshi, and Krillin, while exploring Goku's growth from a naive boy to a skilled martial artist. With its charming blend of action and comedy, *Dragon Ball* laid the foundation for the epic stories that would follow in the franchise....,<br>check out the childhood of son goku </p><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJqGirLjQn4">dragon ball opening</a></h3>
